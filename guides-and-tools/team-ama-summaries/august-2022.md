# August 2022

**August 31, 2022:** [**Project Magnify**](https://projectmagnify.io/create)

* [x] &#x20;Project Magnify is officially in **closed beta** for DKG V6 testnet participants ([bounty program](https://bountyprogram.origintrail.io/) 50k TRAC and 50k OTP)
* [x] &#x20;Participants can now publish assets directly on the **frontend web interface** using test TRAC and test OTP
* [x] &#x20;The team is actively taking questions and helping the community with the Magnify interface on [**Discord**](https://discord.com/channels/460837319025623050/1012026740601786469)
* [x] &#x20;The first iteration of Project Magnify will focus on **helping Web3 users create search results (DKG assets)** and **interacting directly with DKG Nodes and OriginTrail Parachain via the DKG-client (dkg.js)**
* [x] &#x20;DKG v6 is splitting responsibilities between the **clients** and the **node runners**. **You don't need to run a node in order to publish (create assets) anymore** - you can rather connect to the RPC of a node in the network (similar to how blockchains work)
* [ ] &#x20;**Bulk publishing** will be a feature to come later on for NFT creators and such

**August 19, 2022:** [**DKG V6 Testnet Stage 2**](https://bountyprogram.origintrail.io/)

* [x] &#x20;**Increased the amount of TRAC (+added OTP) for bounty program**, totaling 350k TRAC and 50k OTP
* [ ] &#x20;Bounty Program officially confirmed to end when V6 hits mainnet
* [x] &#x20;V6 testnet node runners can now wipe their servers and reinstall a stage 2 node using [these](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-docs/blob/master/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/testnet-node-setup-instructions/setup-instructions-dockerless.md) instructions.
* [x] &#x20;Mapping EVM and Substrate accounts now available through this [interface](https://parachain.origintrail.io/parachain-account-mapping)

**August 18, 2022:** [**TRAC Teleportation**](https://teleport.origintrail.io/)

* [x] &#x20;**Teleportation Batch #1** (10M TRAC) completely filled up within 1 hour
* [x] &#x20;OTP is now **EVM compatible** and **supports hardware wallets** (Ledger)
* [x] &#x20;Two addresses can be used on OTP, **EVM transactions** (with an Ethereum wallet) and **Substrate transactions** (with Polkadot wallet)
* [ ] &#x20;Teleported TRAC can be used by:
  * **Asset Publishers** to mint their own [**Web3 UALs**](https://twitter.com/\_i\_o\_t\_b/status/1458896467733606410) for search results, native NFTs, social profile and to magnify their search performance
  * **Token Holders** to delegate to DKG nodes, delegate OTP to parachain collators, and provide liquidity to the new native TRAC-OTP AMM Liquidity pool
  * **System runners** to run DKG v6 nodes, run OTP collators, build applications with the DKG and UALs with SDKs
  * **Asset consumers** to search Web3 for verifiable assets - social media posts, art, NFTs and real world assets published on the DKG and purchase UALs and own their linked assets

### **August 16, 2022: Twitter Space**

* [ ] &#x20;**DKG Mainnet Launch on September 8, 2022** after the completion of the first TRAC Teleportation Batch
* [ ] &#x20;**DKG BETA Stage 2** and **Magnify Project** begin August 19
* [ ] &#x20;DKG V6 is **enterprise ready** with interest of new enterprises we haven't heard before
