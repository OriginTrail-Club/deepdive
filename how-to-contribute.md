# How to Contribute

## Become an editor

If you would like to help the TRAC community build this page, please follow the steps below:

1. Create your own [GitHub ](https://github.com/)account
2.  On the top right corner of this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Valcyclovir/tracdeepdive), click **fork**&#x20;

    You have now successfully "copied" this website into your GitHub account ! Now all changes you make will be under your account.&#x20;
3. When you are done editing a file, you can **save** the changes
4. Then, go back to your main Repository page
5. &#x20;Click on **Contribute** and then **Open Pull Request**
6. You can write a description, then click **Create Pull Request**
7. &#x20;The changes will then be sent back to my main Repository pending my review. Done !

Another way to edit your repository is by using [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This program will allow you a lot more options rather than directly modifying on GitHub.&#x20;

1. Once you have installed VS code, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
2. Then, install the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension
3. Log in to your GitHub account on the extension
4. In the browser window popup, you will receive your authorization token
5. Copy the token, and switch back to VS Code
6. Select **Signing in to github.com...** in the Status bar, paste the token, and hit Enter
7. Once signed in, click on **Open Folder** to select a local folder that will serve as your working directory
8.  Open your browser, and copy the address of your GitHub Repository.&#x20;

    Mine, for example, is: [https://github.com/Valcyclovir/tracdeepdive](https://github.com/Valcyclovir/tracdeepdive)
9. Go back to VS code, press F1
10. On the command palette, type the following:

    git clone \<paste the address you copied on step 8 here>

Your GitHub Repository is now on VS code and you can use it to edit tracdeepdive !

The principle is the same as before. Once you're done editing a page, ctrl+s to **save** the edited file on your local computer, then **commit** it to your GitHub Repository, and finally, create a **Pull Request** to my main Repository for my review. Everything can be done within VS Code !

Welcome to the #derpdive gang and thanks for contributing !
