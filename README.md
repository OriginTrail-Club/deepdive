# Introduction

OriginTrail is an **open protocol** that can integrate blockchains and legacy systems through open standards – full compliance with [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/), [EPCIS 2.0/CBV](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-joins-the-gs1-global-epcis-cbv-2-0-a032b98d9437) and [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/).

Simply put, it is the combination of two technologies:

1. [Knowledge Graphs](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/) – which are advanced databases used by big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Uber to derive value from user data.
2. Blockchain – which enables decentralization, meaning the database is not controlled by for-profit companies.

When combining these two, it provides a backbone that decentralized applications can be built on, leveling the playing field and giving users back control of their data. OriginTrail **Decentralized Knowledge Graph** makes physical assets (art, healthcare, fashion, education) and digital assets (Metaverse, NFTs, blockchain, DeFi) **discoverable**, **verifiable** and **valuable**.&#x20;

### For starters, let's delve into this video

### Let's hear a few words from the Father of Ethernet

### Dr. Bob Metcalfe

> #### “OriginTrail is going to continue to rise because the Decentralized Knowledge Graph will give AI more and more data.”

> #### “The weakness of OriginTrail is that it’s too complicated to explain to ordinary mortals. The technology appears a bit like middleware, which is a category that only tends to excite a handful of people, and I’m one of them” [source](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ethernet-creator-metcalfe-web3-will-have-all-kinds-of-network-effects/)

### A word from one of the Founders

### [Žiga Drev](https://twitter.com/DrevZiga)

#### "Data is such an integral part of our lives and it’s going to continue to become even more and more integral as we move into a more globally digitized world. As such, our mission and our core objectives are only going to become more and more important. Data needs to be trusted, it needs to be easily verifiable, and it needs to all speak the same language. There are so many use cases from this that include everything from supply chain management to certification to identification and right through to true data autonomy for the individual. What’s really needed is the protocol to do all of this, and this is what we provide and what we are continuing to perfect and fine-tune. "
