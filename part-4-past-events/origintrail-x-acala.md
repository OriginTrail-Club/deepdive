As of Nov. 19th, 2021, one day after Acala won the first Polkadot auction parachain ever, OriginTrail and Acala announced a [partnership](https://twitter.com/AcalaNetwork/status/1461686575566409730?s=20) by integrating the Decentralized Knowledge Graph on Acala, allowing physical and digital assets within the DKG to be queryable and indexable among other things. Branimir, co-Founder of OriginTrail and CTO, alongside Dan Reecer, Acala VP of Growth, discuss what a DKG is, and how Acala ecosystem developers will leverage it.

Once integrated, the TRAC token on the Acala blockchain could then be used as a base gas token or pay for any transactions, making the process seamless and much less complex for both implementation and handling. Using the substrate off chain worker pallet for OriginTrail, this integration will enable any Acala smart contracts or any applications built on top to query verifiably the Decentralized Knowledge Graph and also publish data or assets. The process will be very modular and the connection will be enabled out of the box. This integration is very powerful since it enables infrastructure to not only query a data or asset from the DKG, but also to do verifiable operations within a smart contract based on individual criterias.

In a nutshell, the integration goes in two ways. First, Acala will become another chain OriginTrail extends to, making the DKG accessible. Second, the rest of Polkadot’s ecosystem as well as anyone using Acala will get access to the DKG to query and publish data to it.

Another integration within this partnership was also highlighted by Dan Reecer. The Acala stable coin will be used within the OriginTrail ecosystem. This is a completely new idea that hasn’t been part of OriginTrail’s plan up until now, but having this possibility will allow for more building blocks and great ideas, enhancing network effects for all parties involved.
