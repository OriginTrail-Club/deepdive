# Fashion & Apparel

[Matthew Williams](https://www.instagram.com/matthewmwilliams/?hl=en), the fashion designer behind the 1017 ALYX 9SM brand, wanted to bring greater transparency to the label’s supply chain and cultivate deeper connections with the consumers. By scanning the unique digital code on an item's label with their smartphone, consumers can view the garment’s journey and track it all the way from the factory to the point-of-sale. This raises the bar on the promise of transparency and sustainability in the apparel industry.

### EVRYTHNG

OriginTrail and EVRYTHNG[ partnered up in 2018](https://medium.com/origintrail/connecting-smart-products-with-origintrail-announcing-partnership-with-evrythng-52cb7345b8e8) with the goal of **connecting smart products** with the OriginTrail protocol. The first concept implementation was made using EVRYTHNG’s signature Barry the Bear, a toy bear equipped with RFID and NFC chips, as well as a QR code tag, to allow end-to-end supply chain traceability and product authentication. The project gained traction when it was presented as a blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting solution at the European Commission in Brussels.
