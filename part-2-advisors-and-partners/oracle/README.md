# Oracle

Oracle and OriginTrail partnered up back on Dec. 8th, 2018. As posted by Oracle [tweet](https://twitter.com/orclblockchain/status/1070678005763190784?lang=ar): “_**We are thrilled to partner w/@origin\_trail** to deliver secure and trusted data sharing for supply chains using #blockchain technology_.”

This solution is related to Automatic Dairy payments. What this is and how it functions can be seen in the video below, and more recently this [article](https://twitter.com/SmartAgriHubs/status/1458414682134523909) by SmartAgriHubs.
