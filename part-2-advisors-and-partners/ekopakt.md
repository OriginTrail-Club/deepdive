[EIP-Ekopakt](https://ekopakt.eu/) is a Slovenian, EU funded project using the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and other digital technologies to connect data across a variety of stakeholders in the organic beef supply chain and enable Farm to Fork transparency. Using OriginTrail decentralized technology, the project provides trust and integrity to supply chain data and increases consumer confidence in organic beef production in Slovenia.

&#x20;EIP-EKOPAKT has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Rural development 2014-2020 for Operational Groups (in the sense of Art 56 of Reg.1305/2013).
