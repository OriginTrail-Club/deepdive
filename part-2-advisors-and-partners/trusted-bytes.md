# Trusted Bytes

Trusted Bytes is an [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) project where BSI and Trace Labs are harnessing the power of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge graph to streamline international trade. Building on the fundamentals of SCAN Trusted Factory, the solution seeks to combine an enhanced Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) framework with shipment and telemetry data to provide UK customs with a comprehensive and verifiable shipment risk assessment.

Having a strong focus on interoperability, the solution is one of the first to utilize the novel GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard for supply chain event visibility, along with RDF and SPARQL standards native to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

Digital transformation is changing the way organizations operate and we’re confident that, by bringing together our expertise in supply chain security and trade compliance with the latest technology, we can help improve transparency, increase resilience and enhance long-term sustainability.”
