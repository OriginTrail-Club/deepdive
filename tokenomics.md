# Tokenomics

## **TRAC token**

****![](<.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)****

### Facts

* **Max supply: 500M** Non-inflationary, all distributed during ICO
* **Circulating supply: 368M** The remainder 132M tokens are tagged for the dev pool (see illustration below)
* **Markets with liquidity**: Coinbase, Kucoin, Bancor, Uniswap
* **Token Sale Complete**: January 17, 2018
* **Token Standard**: ERC-20&#x20;
* **ICO price**: $0.10 (0.00007968 ETH)
* **Contract Address**: 0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f (18 decimal)
* ****[**Original 2017 whitepaper**](https://origintrail.io/storage/documents/OriginTrail-White-Paper.pdf)****
* ****[**New 2022 whitepaper**](https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper)****

The following table shows the current TRAC token distribution. As described in the [2020 Q1 Report](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-quarterly-report-q1-2020-f19b9fa95596), all of the TRAC available in the “soft lock” column will be used in the protocol development fund for future improvements (132.5 million total).

OriginTrail TRAC layer-2 token is the life and blood of the entire ecosystem. It is required to perform all operations on the DKG. It is an utility token that drives the entire network:

* **Publishing and updating assets** – asset creators, such as enterprises, organizations, companies, even individuals must use TRAC to compensate OriginTrail node runners for holding their data for a period of time. This will be the main driving for TRAC’s tokenomics.
* **Collateral on OriginTrail nodes** – node runners must lock up TRAC as a collateral for holding asset publishes. The more TRAC locked up in the node, the more likely the node is chosen as the asset holder.
* **Delegating to nodes** – token holders who do not wish to maintain a node have the possibility to delegate their TRAC to node runners, and in return obtain a portion of the rewards.
* **Keyword staking** – Assets owners (enterprises, organizations, companies or individuals) can lock up TRAC to have their assets prioritized in a search result for a particular keyword, similar to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/). This is akin to a decentralized form of marketing spending in Web3 fashion.
* **Data marketplace** – TRAC as a fungible token under ERC-20 standards is transferable and usable in any way ERC-20 assets are. TRAC can therefore be used in smart contracts that allow TRAC to be used as a compensation token for selling or buying assets. Data creators can earn from ownership of valuable data assets

The OriginTrail Parachain super-charges these data marketplaces with the addition of **knowledge tokens, knowledge wallets, the knowledge marketplace, and knowledge tenders**. They allow individuals to buy and sell data in a trusted, private way; the developers say this will increase TRAC’s utility _by orders of magnitude._ Because this is tied into to the Polkadot ecosystem, all Polkadot/Kusama projects will be able to utilize this feature. Please see the [2021 Roadmap for a very in-depth look](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-2021-expanded-roadmap-accelerating-growth-through-starfleet-polkadot-and-knowledge-2a1c170daaf3) at this use case.

## OTP **token**

****![](<.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)****

### **Facts**

* **Max supply: 1B**
* **Circulating supply: TBD**
  * The initial distribution (first 2 years) was planned to be 500M tokens. However, several factors explained below led to a much lower number
  * **25%** of the genesis distribution comes **unlocked**
  * **75%** of the distribution is **unlocked progressively over the course of the 2 years**
* **5% inflation rate** **per year** **up to 1B max supply**

The OTP layer-1 token is the OriginTrail Parachain. It is designed as a **gas and reward token**. Rather than relying on ETH, MATIC, XDAI as gas tokens for network transactions, OTP will be used to pay for gas on the OriginTrail Parachain. OTP is also a reward token that **incentivizes growth** of the DKG on the Origintrail Parachain, making sure the **OriginTrail Parachain is the most attractive blockchain layer for the DKG**. In other words, our parachain (layer-1) requires a token, OTP, to function as gas for transactions and as a reward for [collators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-collator) for processing blocks back to Polkadot (layer-0). The DKG (layer-2), powered solely by TRAC, is interoperable and therefore not exclusively linked to the parachain – it is still fully functional on Gnosis, Polygon and Ethereum. However, the new iteration of the DKG will only be available on OriginTrail Parachain until the team deploys v6 to other blockchains.&#x20;

Below is a detailed description of the OTP utility token:

* **Gas fees** - for transactions, smart contracts and graph contracts (released at a later date)
* **Incentivizing collators** - collators who perform network functions are required to lock up OTP to signal the amount of stake they are willing to keep locked for a period of time in order to receive OTP rewards. The higher the locked amount, the greater the chance a collator candidate gets placed inthe group of rewarded collators
* **Delegate to collators** - OTP holders who are not collators can delegate their OTP and earn a part of the reward
* **Governance and voting** - OTP holders can lock their OTP to vote on update proposals for OriginTrail Parachain network and community treasury proposals
* **Data marketplace** - OTP as a fungible token, just like TRAC, can be used in a **** data marketplace environment using smart contracts

Please consult the [**2022 whitepaper**](https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=genesis-distribution) to learn about the distribution of OTP.
